# SonarLint Exec (WIP)

## Background
This is a very work-in-progress attempt to embed SonarLint in a standalone runnable jar.
The motivation for this is that, while SonarQube is excellent, it is nice to be able to run
SonarLint locally as part of a build process.

SonarLint for IntelliJ is also excellent, but enforcing its use by developers is difficult and there
may be times when an appropriate IDE is not available. Hence the motivation to be able to run this
standalone.

The idea is that this could then be embedded in both a command line tool as well as a Maven plugin.

But it is still very much a work-in-progress...
